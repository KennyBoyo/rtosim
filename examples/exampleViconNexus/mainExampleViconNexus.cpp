/*This example shows how to use rtosim APIs to connect to Vicon Nexus.
Requirements: ViconDataStreamSDK 1.9+, Vicon Nexus, Vicon Virtual System [optional].

Tested using Vicon Nexus 2.10, ViconDataStreamSDK 1.9, Vicon Virtual System 1.4.1.
Before running this example, ensure your ViconDataStreamSDK directory containing the appriate dll
files is in your system path. For ViconDataStreamSDK 1.9 this directory is Vicon/DataStream SDK/Win64/CPP

Open Vicon Nexus, using the Data Management panel open the directory rtosim/data/ViconNexus. 
Open the trial walking_1 and click Play. In the 3D perspective you should see 
the labelled markers moving. This is all you need to do, leave Vicon Nexus playing the trail and 
launch this example. Every time you replay a C3D file, Vicon Nexus streams the data, which can be 
captured using the ViconDataStreamSDK. In this modality, Vicon Nexus does
not always stream all data frames, and some are dropped to maintain performance. If you want to force 
all frames to be streamed you need to select Play Every Frame in the dropdown menu close to the
Play button.

If you want to simulate laboratory condition, you can use the Vicon Virtual System. This allows
to emulate the connection with Vicon cameras, including real-time labelling of the subject.
Open Vicon Virtual System. Load the .x1d and .x2d files and click stream. Now open Vicon Nexus,
click on Go Live, under Manage Camera Calibration, load the .xcp file. You should now see the 
markers being streamed and automatically labelled in the 3D Perspective section of Vicon Nexus.
You can now adjust the camera frequency in the left panel. You can now launch this example.
